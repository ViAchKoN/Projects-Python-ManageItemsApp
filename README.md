Important!
Make sure that you have installed PostgreSQL database: http://www.postgresql.org/download/.

Create python virtual environment:
```
  python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
```
Activate venv and install required modules:
```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Python script called `init_db.py` located in project's source can be used to generate database/database for tests
as well to delete all database data associated with this application.

To create an empty database use:
```
  python3 init_db.py setup or setup_test
```
To delete created database and all associated data with this app, use the parameter `teardown` instead of `setup`:
```
  python3 init_db.py teardown or teardown_test
```
Before starting the application it is required to apply migrations to create table inside the database.
To do that `cd application` into folder and use:
```
  flask db upgrade
```

## Launch

```
  flask run
```
